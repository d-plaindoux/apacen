# Apacen

## Prolog 

The current Prolog kernel is an ad-hoc implementation in Kotlin. 
It does not use research results like the Warren abstract machine.

## Objectives

### Expressivity

The first objective is to express the manipulation of
data structures using operators and constructors.

### Additional Solver

Second objective is the design of SAT and SMT solving in Prolog
